	<p class='pcon'> Crime classification is the process of categorizing criminal offenses into different types or classes based on their nature, severity, and other characteristics. The classification of crimes helps law enforcement agencies and criminal justice systems to better understand and manage criminal activity, to allocate resources efficiently, and to develop appropriate responses to different types of criminal behavior. By using deep learning, it is possible to analyze images and video footage of crime scenes or incidents and classify different types of crimes based on the type of activity depicted in the images. This can be useful in a variety of criminal justice and law enforcement.
